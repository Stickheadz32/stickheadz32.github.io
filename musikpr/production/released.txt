		"A replica I made for the infolink in <i>Deus Ex</i>. Graphics made with MS Paint. Edited with Vegas Pro. Why Paint and not Photoshop? Because I didn't have Photoshop on the computer I made this on at the time. Yay.",
		"The background color of the graphics is black, and I removed the black color with Chroma Keyer on Vegas Pro (similar to greenscreen, but this lets you choose which color to remove)."
